# Classification-Algorithms

The following three algorithms have been implemented to classify data.
* Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis
* A generative approach using Bayes Theorem
* Logistic Regression

A C++ library named armadillo has been used for linear algebra functions. To install the library and its dependencies run the following commands in your terminal.
```sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
```

To run the files please use the following format
`g++ filename.cpp -larmadillo`

Using the testing and training data provided we were able to achieve more than 98% accuracy for every algorithm.
